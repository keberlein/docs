 <title>Best practices for PDF customization plug-ins</title>
 <shortdesc>Adhering to certain development practices will properly isolate your code from that of the DITA Open Toolkit
  (DIT-OT). This will make it easier to you to upgrade to new versions of the DITA-OT when they are
  released.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <ul>
   <li>Use a properly-constructed DITA-OT plug-in.</li>
   <li>Never modify any of the DITA-OT code.<note type="tip">Set the permissions on the
      <filepath>org.dita.pdf2</filepath> directory to read-only, to ensure that you do not accidentally modify the files
     within as you develop your customized plug-in.</note></li>
   <li>Never copy entire DITA-OT files into your customization plug-in. Instead, copy only the attribute sets and
    templates that you need to override.</li>
   <li>Maintain a change log and comment your changes.</li>
   <li>Upgrade your customization plug-in to new versions of the DITA-OT regularly. Do not wait through several major
    releases before upgrading.</li>
  </ul>
